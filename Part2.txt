The island went into the ground.
Turns out it wasn't and island at all, but instead something completly different.
It turned out to be a enormous coconut crab
Running around on the bottom of the ocean.


Suddenly, explosions everywhere!


She stepped of her broom, but what happened next will blow your mind!


The evil stepmother then died.
In a horrible gruesome fire,
Which was very nice for roasting marshmallows over.
Nice and crispy.



And they were murdered by the jolly troll.
The End!
