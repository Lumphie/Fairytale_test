The island went into the ground.
Turns out it wasn't and island at all, but instead something completely different.
It turned out to be a enormous coconut crab
Running around on the bottom of the ocean.
It was so big that it was only partially submerged!
Suddenly, explosions everywhere!
Also underwater!
The crab is clearly a female.
She stepped off her broom, but what happened next will blow your mind!
The evil stepmother then died.
In a horrible gruesome fire,
Which was very nice for roasting marshmallows over.
Nice and crispy.
And they lived happily ever after.
At least, that is what we think, no one ever saw then again.
