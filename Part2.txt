The island went into the ground.
Turns out it wasn't and island at all, but instead something completely different.
It turned out to be a enormous coconut crab
Running around on the bottom of the ocean.
It was so big that it was only partially submerged!
Suddenly, explosions everywhere!
Also underwater!
The crab is clearly a female.
She stepped off her broom, but what happened next will blow your mind!
The evil stepmother then died.
In a horrible gruesome fire,
Which was very nice for roasting marshmallows over.
Nice and crispy.



And they were murdered by the jolly troll.
The End!
