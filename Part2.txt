Then suddenly something happened

The island went into the ground.
Turns out it wasn't and island at all, but instead something completely different.
It turned out to be a enormous coconut crab
Running around on the bottom of the ocean.
It was so big that it was only partially submerged!
Suddenly, explosions everywhere!
Also underwater!
And in the air!
The crab is clearly a female.
She stepped off her broom, but what happened next will blow your mind!
An upside catfish appeared from the depths and grew larger and larger until it reached the sand.
It was the size of the martini tower and covered in slime.
The catfish was wearing a crown made of skeleton bones and was smoking a pipe.

The evil stepmother then died.
In a horrible gruesome fire,
Which was very nice for roasting marshmallows over.
Nice and crispy.

And they lived happily ever after.

At least, that is what we think, no one ever saw then again.
And apparently ate the crap meat as well. Yum yum
Then an invasion of giant Mudcrabs arrived trying to remove the surface and
steal the food.

Though not for long,
As a raging forest fire burnt down everything on the island crab.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Destroying the boat and everything else with it.
The Island crab just shrugged and went back to sleep.
