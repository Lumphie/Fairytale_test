The island went into the ground.
Turns out it wasn't and island at all, but instead something completly different.
It turned out to be a enormous coconut crab



Suddenly, explosions everywhere!


She stepped of her broom, but what happened next will blow your mind!


The evil stepmother then died.
In a horrible gruesome fire,
Which was very nice for roasting marshmallows over.
Nice and crispy.



And they lived happily ever after.
Or so they thought....
