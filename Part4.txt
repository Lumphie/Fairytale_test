The evil Count Olaf had been notified by the whale, who thought the family 
did not integrate well with the elephant people. Poor family. 
So Olaf went and set the whole family to light. 
But luckily the three children remained. A very technical young daughter, and knowledgable young son, and a baby girl that was able to bite very well.
Lucky children!
And you may think that was the end, and it was the end!
