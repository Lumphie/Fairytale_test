Once upon a time there was a very nice family and they went on a lot of adventures.
For instance, they went on an adventure with a boat. 
One day they were guided by a whale to a far away island.
The whale preferred the sea over beach, but got stranded anyways.
An island with pure white beaches, covered in palm trees and beach chairs.
There were some people there, so we went to meet them
This land had the strangest inhabitants called Stnatibahni.
Stnatibahni are weird pink elephant people.
The Stnatibanhni had the greatest desire to live in a destopia.
While in fact they were living in the most astonishing land you had ever seen.
This is the story how they made their dream come true.
they were mostly living of coconuts and crabs
sometimes they were also doing a little bit of fishing
