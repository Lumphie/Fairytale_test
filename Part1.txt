/* Guys! let's remember, fairytails are better when they are gruesome */

Once upon a time there was a very nice family and they went on a lot of adventures.
For instance, they went on an adventure with a boat. It was a very nice boat.  
One day they were guided by a whale to a far away island.
The whale preferred the sea over beach, but got stranded anyways.
So the family was left in the island with no food and no shelter 
The island had pure white beaches, covered in palm trees and beach chairs.
There were some people there, so we went to meet them
This land had the strangest inhabitants called Stnatibahni who prefered to use fruit to build their homes.
Stnatibahni are weird pink elephant people.

With big floppy ears.

Their dream always was to be a great family of an island. 
So they went back to their boat, and started to get all their weapons.


Which were mostly large sharpened sticks, as they still hadn't figured out how to work with stone and metal.
