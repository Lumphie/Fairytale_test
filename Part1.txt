Once upon a time there was a very nice family and they went on a lot of adventures.
For instance, they went on an adventure with a boat. It was a very nice boat.  
One day they were guided by a whale to a far away island.
The whale preferred the sea over beach, but got stranded anyways.
An island with pure white beaches, covered in palm trees and beach chairs.
There were some people there, so we went to meet them
This land had the strangest inhabitants called Stnatibahni who prefered to use fruit to build their homes.
Stnatibahni are weird pink elephant people.
