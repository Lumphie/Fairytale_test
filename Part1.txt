Once upon a time there was a very nice family and they went on a lot of adventures.
For instance, they went on an adventure with a boat. 
One day they were guided by a whale to a far away island.
The whale preferred the sea over beach, but got stranded anyways.
An island with pure white beaches, covered in palm trees.
The palm trees, however, lacked coconuts for mysterious reasons. They had spikes instead.
There were some people there, so we went to meet them.
This land had the strangest inhabitants called stnatibahni.
