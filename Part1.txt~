Once upon a time there was a very nice family and they went on a lot of adventures.
For instance, they went on an adventure with a boat. 
One day they were guided by a whale to a far away island.
An island with pure white beaches, covered in palm trees.
There were some people there, so we went to meet them
This land had the strangest inhabitants

 called stnatibahni
