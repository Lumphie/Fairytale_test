/* Guys! let's remember, fairytails are better when they are gruesome, are they? They were in ye olden times*/

Once upon a time there was a very nice family and they went on a lot of adventures.
For instance, they went on an adventure with a boat. It was a very nice pirateship they once stole from Blackbeard. They even took the parrot!  
<<<<<<< HEAD
One day they were guided by a whale to a far far away island.
The whale preferred the sea over beach, but got stranded anyways.
So the family was left in the island with no food and no shelter, because they already ate everything, even the parrot. 
The island had pure white beaches, covered in palm trees and beach chairs. The chair were made from recyclable plastic.

There were some people there, so we went to meet them
<<<<<<< HEAD
This land had the strangest inhabitants called Stnatibahni.
Stnatibahni are weird pink elephant people.
The stnatibanhni had the greatest desire to live in a destopia.
While in fact they were living in the most astonishing land you had ever seen.
This is the story how they made their dream come true.

With big floppy ears that went from their left foot to their right ear.

Their dream was always to be a great family of an island. 
So they went back to their boat, and started to get all their weapons.
<<<<<<< HEAD
And then, the nightmare began...

Which were mostly large sharpened sticks, as they still hadn't figured out how to work with stone and metal.
Stupid elephant people.
<<<<<<< HEAD

The smallest kid, however, found the secret weaponary Blackbeard had made for himself. It was full of sharp knifes,axes and swords.
